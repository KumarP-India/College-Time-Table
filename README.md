# College Time Table
 This is simple Terminal App that reads sorted by the order of priority dataset of things to do based on mood and time available. The logic is that I've but all possible work I can do and they sorted based on priority and grouped them on how many hours I should spend or they need - this just shows them in order and so I don't have to remember everything.

 ### How to install 

 Clone it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KumarP-India/College-Time-Table.git
cd College-Time-Table
```

Install required libraries

```bash
pip install rich InquirerPy
```


### How to run

While you may create a bash or bat file then make it executable file but I think for this app just being python file is better.

Just go to directory in terminal and run it using your python interutpor:

```bash
python main.py
```
